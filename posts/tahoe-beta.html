    Every damn year I do this. I see new beta, I install beta, beta sucks, I
    cry. Why do I keep doing it?

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row">
    <img
        class="raw dialog profile"
        src="/static/speechsad.png"
        alt="drawing of a deer, talking to you."
    />
    <div class="dialog speech jo">
        <p>It looks pretty, though...</p>
    </div>

    Yeah... So basically <em>everything</em> here is worse. I don't really care
    to have "discourse" about the new design, but it sure seems to make even
    basic things like Finder run slow somehow.

        It has some really rough edges too... What even is this? I think the
        glowing "tab bar" is the most offensive thing here.

    One issue is Safari is <em>really</em> slow. Embarrassingly slow. I've long
    been an advocate for not using Chromium, since Google is the devil or
    whatever. But the new Safari update makes using WebKit damn near unusable.
    It can take like, upwards of 30 seconds to open a new tab sometimes. Maybe
    my 8GB M1 Macbook Pro is showing its (rather young) age, but I don't think
    it's just me.
</p>

<p>
    So I decided to make a tentative deal with the devil. I'm currently using...
    Thorium.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row">
    <img
        class="raw dialog profile"
        src="/static/speechyou.png"
        alt="drawing of a deer, talking to you."

    <div class="dialog speech you">
        <p>wtf is thorium??</p>

    <a href="https://thorium.rocks/">Some chrome fork</a> that a friend
    recommended to me. It claims to be
    <em>'The fastest browser on Earth.'</em> Whatever. I just want a no-nonsense
    browser that won't freeze for damn seconds while I work. For that purpose,
    it has been very good.
</p>

<p>
    Why not Firefox? Mainly because it's the only macOS browser that doesn't
    have
    <em>by default</em>
    WebGPU support somehow, and that's like what 80% of what I'm interested in
    right now.

    The new Spotlight is pretty good, though. I've been having fun making
    shortcuts for it. It has the potential to replace Raycast fully (but
    Spotlight has been quite buggy with shortcuts as of now.)

            As of writing, I have not installed macOS 26 Beta 2. Could fix
            everything! Who knows. Might update this post if anything
            interesting happens on this front. That's all I wanted to blog
            about, though. See ya!
