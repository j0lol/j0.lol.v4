<p>
    You may have noticed something in my footer. I have a couple of badges in there for... information? I'm not sure
    really. I think they just look neat. You may have noticed something strange though. One of them is... too detailed.
    Here it is:


</p>


<div class="_88x31s">
    <a href="https://brainmade.org">
        <div style="display: flex; padding: 3px; background-color: #000">
            <img class="raw" alt="The Brainmade Mark" src="/static/badges/brainmade.svg" width=82 height=25>
        </div>
    </a>
</div>

<p>Let's zoom in:
</p>

<div class="_88x31s">
    <a style="width: 176px; height: 62px; display: block;" href="https://brainmade.org">
        <div style="display: flex; padding: 6px; background-color: #000">
            <img class="raw" alt="The Brainmade Mark" src="/static/badges/brainmade.svg" width=164 height=50>
        </div>
    </a>
</div>

<p>It's an SVG!</p>

<p>I made this decision because the website did not at the time have an 88&times;31 badge. And their new one, in my
    opinion, doesn't look very good. It's a bit too rough, I think that the SVG could be safely scaled down instead.</p>

<div class="_88x31s">
    <a href="https://brainmade.org">
        <img class="raw" alt="The Brainmade Mark" src="https://brainmade.org/88x31-dark.png" width=88 height=31>
    </a>
</div>

<p>But this made me think: if you have the opportunity, why not make an SVG 88&times;31? Why not make a 2x
    "176&times;62" for hi-dpi displays?</p>
