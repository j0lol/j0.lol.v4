    Going to preface this post with this: I'm not a programming language
    designer. I don't really know what I'm talking about. I'm just a Rust
    developer with a passing interest in Swift. I probably made some mistakes in
    here, feel free to send me corrections.

    So about a week ago, I was bored and watching WWDC 25 (pronounced "dub dub
    DC", apparently.) I was watching this video:
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/312"
        ><em>Improve memory usage and performance with Swift</em></a
    >, where they show off some new features in Swift to reduce memory overhead
    and increase safety (feel free to watch this alongside!) The first new
    standard library construct they show off is
    <code>InlineArray&lt;N, T&gt;</code>, which acts like... an array. In Rust
    terms, the normal Swift array is similar to a
    <code>Arc&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, where it is a growable collection that
    can be shared across threads and is copied on write. To keep the analogy
    going, the new Swift <code>InlineArray</code> is like a Rust array:
    <code>[T; N]</code>. To make it clear, <code>Array</code> is heap-allocated
    and <code>InlineArray</code> is stack-allocated.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift"><!--
func array() {
    var array = [4, 5, 6]
}

func inlineArray() {
    var array: InlineArray<3, Int> = [4, 5, 6]
}
--></code></pre>

And let's compare to Rust:

<pre><code class="language-rust">
fn vec() {
    // I could wrap this in an Arc, but
    // that's not really what real code would do.
    let mut vec = vec![4, 5, 6];
}

fn array() {
    let mut arr = [4, 5, 6];
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    You can probably see the argument I'm going to make here — This is less
    ergonomic. Rust is often said to have bad syntax, but here you can see that
    the better performing option is <em>just easier</em> than the heap-allocated
    version.
</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>
    So another topic in the video is how to efficiently read from a reference
    counted collection. In order to avoid the reference counter, and read data
    directly, one would previously use an unsafe pointer to do a direct read.
</p>

<figure>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">
    // Safe usage of a buffer pointer
    func processUsingBuffer(_ array: [Int]) -> Int {
        array.withUnsafeBufferPointer { buffer in
            var result = 0
            for i in 0..&lt;buffer.count {
                result += calculate(using: buffer, at: i)
            }
            return result
        }
    }
    </code></pre>

    <figcaption>Example from above WWDC talk, used as a reference.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    As highlighted in the talk, these buffers are unsafe partially because they
    could be used outside of the scope of the function (e.g. returned, or stored
    as part of a structure), and misued. In order to make this operation safe,
    they introduce a type called <code>Span</code>, which points to a
    contiguious block of memory. In order to make this safe, a new "Marker
    trait" (Rust speak) called <code>Escapable</code><a ref="escapable"></a>
    is added to the language. This trait is auto-added to all types by default,
    and you can specify if your type cannot be used outside of its context with
    <code>~Escapable</code>. Pretty neat language feature!
</p>

<p>
    This is a very different approach to Rust. We deal with pointer unsafety by
    relegating them to <em>Unsafe Rust</em>, a language that lives alongside
    <em>Safe Rust</em>. But also — We sidestep this whole problem.
    <code>Vec</code>s are not reference-counted (you have to wrap them in a
    <code>Rc</code> or <code>Arc</code> for that,) so we don't have to sidestep
    the reference counter.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    You can clearly see the difference in these language's designs from these
    two examples. Swift makes working with types as easy as possible, while
    letting you "drop down" for performance. Rust instead makes the most
    ergonomic pattern the most performant, while letting you "build up"
    convenience by moving to heap allocation with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>,
    adding copy-on-write with <code>Cow&lt;T&gt;</code>, or reference counting
    with <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
    I think it's clear who these language features are for — Swift library
    maintainers. Being able to write more performant code for your users will
    make everyone happy, and doing this without unsafety is nice. I don't think
    this is really for app developers, or anything like that. Making all of your
    array accesses use spans to dodge the reference counter is
    <em>technically</em> faster, but makes things much more annoying to maintain
    than the obvious solution. I think the talk makes this clear, as they show
    off a new
    <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-binary-parsing"
        >Binary Parsing library</a
    >
    at the end which uses these new language features.
</p>

<p>
    As for the title of this article. I don't think Swift is becoming
    unergonomic Rust (<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines"
        >Betteridge's law of headlines</a
    >
    wins again.) It's just bringing in features similar to Rust to "drop down"
    to. Honestly, a "less complex" Rust has a good place in the world of
    programming languages. There is some work adjacent to this, see the
    <a href="https://github.com/softdevteam/alloy">Alloy language</a>: a fork of
    Rust that gives you opt-in garbage collection for things like Linked Lists.
    I think it's easy to write things like this off — but all languages have
    their tradeoffs. What makes you a good developer is being able to take all
    of the values of prospective systems and being able to pick the right one<a
        ref="values"
    ></a
    >!

            So Swift calls traits <em>Protocols</em>, and this one is implicitly
            applied to all Swift types. Here's
