    leaves a void in the macOS gaming community of Wine GUIs that don't cost an
    arm and a leg.

<p>
    However, a recent revival of Wineskin has come out, called Kegworks Winery.
    It's pretty decent. Here's a tutorial on how to use it.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Install Kegworks Winery. Here's the
        <a href="https://brew.sh">brew</a> command they have on their GitHub.
        <sup><a href="https://github.com/Kegworks-App">[src]</a></sup>

        <code>
            <pre class="language-sh">
brew upgrade
brew install --cask --no-quarantine Kegworks-App/kegworks/kegworks</pre
            >
        </code>
    </li>

    <li>
        Open it up and install a version of CrossOver wine
        (<samp>WS**WineCX**</samp>)
    </li>

        height="488"
        width="404"
    />
    <li>
        Make a wrapper app (Be prepared for this to take a while, and freeze
        up.)
    </li>

    <li>Open up your new wrapper</li>
    <li>
        Notice that your new wrapper application has an AI generated icon. Ew.
        Change that to something better. (<a

    />
</ol>

<h2>Steam</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        You want to run steam. Probably. Open winetricks and run the steam
        action.
    </li>

    <img
        src="https://f004.backblazeb2.com/file/j0-lol-website/kegwroks/Screenshot%202025-03-22%20at%2017.08.46.png"
        alt=""
        height="727"
        width="803"
    />
    <li>
        Once that's done, go to 'Advanced' and change the Windows app to Steam.

        <img

        You will want to use a DirectX translation layer:
        <ul>
            <li>
                D3DMetal is the official, Apple supported, translation layer.
                This will have the least overhead and, usually, widest
                compatability. If you're unsure, use this one.
            </li>
            <li>
                DXVK is used widely on macOS and Linux for gpu call translation.
                This should be your fallback if D3DMetal fails you.
            </li>
            <li>
                DXMT is a newcomer and focuses only on DirectX11 to Metal
                translation. Some games will work great with this.

<h2>Tweaking</h2>
<p>You may also want to tweak some other graphics settings:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You may get better or worse performance by tweaking which type of
        synchronization you use. There are two options in Kegworks and
        Crossover. Personally, I have not seen any difference between the two.

        <ul>
            <li>Eventfd-based synchronization, or <samp>ESYNC</samp>.</li>
            <li>
                Mach semaphore-based synchronization, or <samp>MSYNC</samp>
                <sup
                    ><a
                        href="https://support.codeweavers.com/advanced-settings-in-crossover-235"
                        >[src]</a
                    ></sup

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        High DPI mode. If you're on an Apple display, you probably have a high
        DPI. This is quite annoying to do.
        <ol>
            <li>Open <samp>regedit</samp></li>
            <li>Go to <samp>HKCU\Software\Wine\Mac Driver</samp></li>
            <li>
                Then set a new string value <samp>RetinaMode</samp> to
                <samp>Y</samp>
                <sup
                    ><a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1gees5s/comment/lu9dlsx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"
                        >[src]</a
                    ></sup
                >
            </li>
            <li>Open <samp>winecfg</samp></li>
            <li>
                Change the dpi. Note that the default is 96dpi. For a 2&times;
                DPI monitor, go for <small>96 &times; 2 = </small> 192dpi.
            </li>
        </ol>

        If you're often switching between high dpi and 96dpi monitors, I would
        recommend making a separate wrapper app so you don't have to undo and
        redo this hack constantly.

        <br /><br />
        <b>EDIT:</b> I made a tool to automate this:
        <a href="https://github.com/j0lol/winebottle-retina-toggler"
            >winebottle-retina-toggler</a
        >. I also made an
        <a href="https://github.com/Kegworks-App/Kegworks/issues/79"
            >issue on Kegworks Winery</a
        >
        in hopes of a better solution.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
Theoretically, Steam should "just work." Give it a test run before you close
your wrapper app. If your wrapper stops working, open up your wrapper
<samp>.app</samp> with "Show Package Contents" and open
<samp>KegworksConfig.app</samp> to get access to the config menu again.

<p>
    Annoyingly, Steam is quite buggy in wine. This is just because Steam sucks.
    It's a web browser running through three translation layers (D3DMetal, Wine,
    Rosetta 2.) It is still pretty usable, though, and the macOS build of Steam
    isn't much better!
</p>

<h2>Performance and Compatability</h2>
It's alright. The main issue is memory constraints. If you have an 8gb Apple
device, you will feel this when you try and load large games. If you want good
benchmarks, I can recommend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Andytizer">Andrew Tsai</a>'s channel. If you
need other performance & compatability details, try the
<a href="https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/Home">AppleGamingWiki</a>.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    This kinda sucks, right? Why can't Valve Corporation just do this for us?
    Who knows. I think they just hate us macOS users.
