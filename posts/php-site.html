<p>I remade my website! I went from using Rust to PHP!</p>

<h1>Why? Don't you love Rust?</h1>

<p>I love Rust! I don't love using the wrong tool for the job though! I think that PHP is the perfect language for a <strong>P</strong>ersonal <strong>H</strong>ome <strong>P</strong>age.</p>

<ul>
    <li>It's interpreted, so I don't have to recompile the thing every time I want to change something</li>
    <li>PHP is quick and easy, and comes with great templating built in.

        <ul>
            <li>In Rust, I had to import <code>minijinja</code> to do this</li>
        </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Rust web development is dependency hell!</h2>

<p>Dependencies in Rust suck. They add to your compile time, mess up your <code>Cargo.toml</code>, and if they have macros they're even worse for compile time!</p>

<p>Look at all the dependencies I used to make this site!</p>

<pre><code class="toml">[dependencies]
ansi-to-html = "0.2.1"
axum = "0.7.4"
chrono = "0.4.35"
comrak = "0.21.0"
erased-serde = "0.4.4"
include_dir = "0.7.3"
itertools = "0.12.1"
kdl = "4.6.0"
knuffel = "3.2.0"
miette = { version = "7.2.0", features = ["fancy"] }
minijinja = { version = "1.0.16", features = ["loader"] }
rand = "0.8.5"
select = "0.6.0"
serde = { version = "1.0.197", features = ["derive"] }
syntect = "5.2.0"
thiserror = "1.0.58"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tower-http = { version = "0.5.2", features = ["fs"] }
tracing-subscriber = "0.3.18"
</code></pre>

<p>How many dependencies do I have in PHP?</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "require": {
        "altorouter/altorouter": "^2.0",
        "michelf/php-markdown": "^2.0"
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Two! I could probably get it even lower if I were to use my web server's routing, but ehhhhhhhhhh</p>

<p>Altorouter is a pretty nice to use router, and PHP Markdown renders my blog's posts.</p>

<h1>Okay, but how do you do syntax highlighting?</h1>

<p>PHP-Markdown doesn't come with it! We need to shoehorn it in ourselves.</p>

<p>After looking around, I found <code>Shiki-PHP</code>, which offers code highlighting by making bindings to <code>Shiki</code>: <a href="https://github.com/spatie/shiki-php">https://github.com/spatie/shiki-php</a></p>

<p>However, <code>Shiki</code> is slow. Very slow. It uses <em>Node JS</em>. As we both know, running JavaScript on the server is the worst thing you can do for your poor program.</p>

<h2>A solution</h2>

<p>I used <code>Syntect</code> before to do highlighting in Rust. It's very good! Just one issue: It's in Rust!</p>

<h3>Let's use Rust in PHP!</h3>

<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs">ext-php-rs</a>, all I need to do is to make a stub program to hook <code>Syntect</code> in, then install it as a PHP Module.</p>

<p>I need two functions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>One, to turn code into HTML</li>
    <li>Another, to generate CSS for the highlighting</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-rust">#[php_function]
pub fn syntect_highlight(code: &str, language_ext: &str) -> String {
    let syntax_set = SyntaxSet::load_defaults_newlines();
    let syntax = syntax_set.find_syntax_by_extension(language_ext).unwrap();
    let mut html_generator = ClassedHTMLGenerator::new_with_class_style(syntax, &syntax_set, ClassStyle::Spaced);
    for line in LinesWithEndings::from(code) {
        html_generator.parse_html_for_line_which_includes_newline(line).unwrap();
    }
    let output_html= html_generator.finalize();
    output_html
}

#[php_function]
pub fn syntect_css(theme_path: &str) -> String {
    let theme = ThemeSet::get_theme(PathBuf::from(theme_path)).unwrap();
    css_for_theme_with_class_style(&theme, ClassStyle::Spaced).unwrap()
}</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can just build this with <code>cargo build</code>, and uh. Get a <code>.dylib</code>.</p>

<p>Our glue library <code>ext-php-rs</code> offers a solution to install this all for us, but it doesn't work on my machine! And it seems abandoned!
    Instead, let's just install it ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

    <p>I got this working on my Ubuntu Server! Not my MacOS laptop though. I had to build it from git instead of the latest version though.</p>

    <p><code>cargo install cargo-php --git https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs</code></p>

    <p>If you have PHP installed globally you will have to install it on the super-user (use sudo).
        Overall this seems spotty, and I'm looking for an alternative to this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <strong><code>cargo-php</code></strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn get_ext_dir() -> AResult&lt;PathBuf&gt; {
    let cmd = Command::new("php")
        .arg("-r")
        .arg("echo ini_get('extension_dir');")
        .output()
        .context("Failed to call PHP")?;</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so...</p>

<pre><code class="shell">$ php -r "echo ini_get('extension_dir');"

/opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20230831

$ # Please ignore how i blatantly misspelled syntect here. Shame on me.
$ cp ./target/release/libsyntext_ext_php.dylib /opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20230831
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, now we need to enable it in <code>php.ini</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="shell">$ nvim /opt/homebrew/etc/php/8.3/php.ini



extension=libsyntext_ext_php.dylib

[ Normal ]    /opt/homebrew/etc/php/8.3/php.ini    976:1
:x</code></pre>

<p>Now we can use it in PHP. Awesome! The code blocks on this site are being rendered like this :)</p>

<p>Note that this technically adds a third dependency, if you were keeping track. Better than 19!!</p>

<p>Also: if you want to use it, here's the repo: <a href="https://github.com/j0lol/ext-php-syntect">https://github.com/j0lol/ext-php-syntect</a></p>
