    So. Raycast is a replacement for Apple's Spotlight, a quick search
    accessible anywhere in macOS with <kbd>⌘+Space</kbd>. It is "extendable", in
    that it has an in-app extensions library which add entries which do various
    things. This is useful in various ways, but I mostly use it to quick-search
    various websites, like Kagi or MDN.

    In macOS Tahoe, Apple lets you run "Shortcuts" from Spotlight. These
    <em>can</em>
    take a text input directly in Spotlight, and run basically whatever. One
    decent use for this is to run something like <code>brew update</code> to
    update your packages.

    <summary>What are "Shortcuts"?</summary>

    Imagine if Scratch was integrated into your OS. You can organise blocks to
    make a kind of annoying form of computing. It has strange limitations.

    One neat thing is that you can bind a shortcut to a.... shortcut? Like, they
    call this "Quick Keys", but it's like a shortcut alias. If I want to search
    Kagi, I can make a <code>kg</code> alias, then <kbd>kg↩︎Foo</kbd> to search
    "Foo" on Kagi.

<p>
    That's basically it. Shortcuts are kind of fun to make, but can be a bit
    infuriating if you don't know how to use the esoteric blocks. On macOS, you
    can at least fall back to <code>sh</code>, or a scripting language like
    Python.

        Here's all the shortcuts I've made so far. Can't really think of any
        more I could make.

            This kinda works for me. There's definitely more that Raycast can do
            that Shortcuts can't right now, but it's pretty decent right now!
            Definitely enough for me to stop using it. Your use case is probably
            different, though. I know a lot of people would hate a workflow like
            this, and prefer to use the browser and/or the CLI.
