<p>
    My site went down! This is because the syntax highlighting library I made in an <a href="/blog/php-site">older blog post</a> broke!
    Instead of just updating it (it was a pain because <code>ext-php-rs</code> is hard to use...)
    I just replaced it with <a href="https://prismjs.com">Prism.JS</a>.

</p>

<p>
    This library is a lot simpler and better maintained.
    The only downside is that highlighting happens on the frontend, which probably means some sort of <abbr title="Flash of Un-styled Content">FOUC</abbr> happens.
    The benefit is that I don't have to maintain a PHP library in Rust.
</p>

<p>While doing this, I realised that I could make a lot of my site a lot easier to maintain if I just drop build steps.</p>

<h2>Blogging in HTML</h2>

<p>It's not that hard! The downsides of having to use XML-y tags everywhere is that you gain the benefits of concrete syntax. Another benefit is <em>Semantic HTML</em>, which let's me do things like <abbr title="Abbreviations">abbr's</abbr>. </p>

<p>It's pretty fun to read all the semantic tags and try them out. And it's fun to read the MDN! <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Click here</a> for a combination of both of these. <samp>=)</samp></p>

<h2>Styling</h2>

<p>I changed the font on my website from Cascadia Code to Maple Mono. I think it complements the body font a lot better! And I use the font in my editor now instead of Cascadia.</p>

<p>While changing styling, I found a horrible bug where a <code>&#x3C;pre&#x3E;&#x3C;code&#x3E;</code> block's contents would influence the size of the document's page, even when scrolling. To fix this, my partner figured out that because I was using a <code>display: grid;</code> element as a document wrapper, the grid was calculating it's <code>min-width</code> with the minimum size of all elements in the body. </p>

<p>
    The fix, of course, is trivial:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

main {
    /*
      Needed, otherwise .wrapper grid will use `min-width: min-content`.
      Problematic if an element expands past 100vw,
      where it will cause main to grow massively.

     */
    min-width: 0;
}</code></pre>

<h3>Dialog box</h3>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row">
    <img class="raw dialog profile" src="/static/speechdeer.png" alt="drawing of a deer, talking to you.">
    <div class="dialog speech jo"><p>This was pretty fun to implement! I used the MDN <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders/Border-image_generator">border-image generator</a> to make the dialog box, then I drew the deer on the left :-)</div>
</div>

<p>That's about it, other than some other stylesheet cleanup (I removed a bunch of <code>calc</code>s and moved some <code>px</code> values to <code>rem</code>!)
    Keep things simple! <span class="pona">󱥄󱥔</span></p>
