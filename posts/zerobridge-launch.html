    I wrote a Discord bridge for Minecraft 1.4.7! I might go in depth about this
    in another blog post, but for now, here's a link:
    <a href="https://git.gay/j0/ZeroBridge">ZeroBridge</a>
</p>

<h2>Okay here's a bit of talk</h2>

<p>
    It runs in NilLoader, and is mainly targeted for the pack Rewind Upsilon. It
    was really fun to make! NilLoader is very barebones, and most of the code is
    directly injected into Minecraft via MiniTransformer. For some reason, I
    find working with ASM (Java Bytecode Manipulator) to be quite nice.

    I originally started work on this project maybe a year ago? I digged it out
    recently from my backups because I wanted to play Upsilon but the people I
    want to play with <em>really</em> want a Discord bridge. I basically rewrote
    the entire thing to play nice when inside Rewind Upsilon. I also added a
    config (with Jankson), webhooks (with Visage rendering), a bunch of other
    stuff that makes it feel like a real thing.

<p>Anyway, enjoy!</p>
