<p>I added comments to my site!</p>

<p>It works by linking to a bluesky post, and mirroring the comments to my website. It's pretty cool :)</p>

<p>Here's the basics of how to use it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">
    &#x3C;!-- You should download and mirror the script if possible! --&#x3E;
    &#x3C;!-- https://github.com/LoueeD/bsky/blob/main/comments.js --&#x3E;
    &#x3C;script type=&#x22;module&#x22; src=&#x22;https://esm.sh/gh/loueed/bsky@v1.0.0/comments&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;

    &#x3C;!-- You can plug your post URL into https://pdsls.dev to get the URI here. --&#x3E;

<p>Yeah, that's basically it. I didn't make it or anything. Just want to show it off.</p>

<p>The only issue is... how am I going to post this and get the ATproto uri before I publish it?</p>
