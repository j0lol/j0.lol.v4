<p>I added comments to my site!</p>

<p>It works by linking to a bluesky post, and mirroring the comments to my website. It's pretty cool :)</p>

<p>Here's the basics of how to use it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">

    <!-- You should download and mirror the script if possible! -->
    <!-- https://github.com/LoueeD/bsky/blob/main/comments.js -->
    <script type="module" src="https://esm.sh/gh/loueed/bsky@v1.0.0/comments"></script>

    <!-- You can plug your post URL into https://pdsls.dev to get the URI here. -->
    <bsky-comments post="at://did:plc:by6abidhbnj6siox5if2wzq6/app.bsky.feed.post/3llckts3ryc2w"></bsky-comments>
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, that's basically it. I didn't make it or anything. Just want to show it off.</p>

<p>The only issue is... how am I going to post this and get the ATproto uri before I publish it?</p>
